## Psychiatric Disorders

Psychiatric Disorders are mental illness diagnosed by a mental health professional that greatly disturbs your thinking, moods, and/or behavior. Currently, the misdiagnosis rate for mental disorders like Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are extremely high. 

## Description

I have created a Deep Learning models using Pytorch that classifies ADHD, Schizophrenia, and Depression based on Electroencephalography (EEG) readings of the brain.
